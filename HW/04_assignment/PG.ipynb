    "There are three places in the code to fill:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The method `policy_backward`, which will compute the gradients.\n",
    "2. In the `train` method, you need to write the gradient for the final output layer (i.e., the last gradient in the overall computational graph) and store that in a list to be used at the end of the episode.\n",
    "3. Also in the `train` method, you need to utilize the discounted rewards you wrote and integrate it into the computation of the gradient. In addition, you need to keep the overall `grad_buffer` up to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you complete these, you should be able to train your agent on CartPole (and Pong, if desired).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get full credit for this portion run CartPole with `max_episodes=400`, and report the final running reward, as well as a plot of all the running reward values. (The cell after the training call should do these two automatically.) You should aim to get a final running_reward of **at least 200.00**, and the plot for the running_rewards should show a clear upward trend, though it may sometimes decrease if there are games that last abnormally long. For reference, our implementation usually achieves running rewards of 500-5000 after 400 episodes. From our experience, the performance varies a lot with CartPole; we have gotten scores as high as a million, so save any output that meets the 200-score requirement.\n",

    "Some additional comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You do not need to change the default hyperparameters provided, such as `learning_rate`. If you need to change one of them to get the minimum performance -- or if you think there's a compelling reason to do so -- explain your changes in a new text/Markdown cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Please keep `print_every=2` (or some other reasonable value) so that we can spot-check the rewards and running rewards per episode."

You will need to check the following: (1) that the game can be reduced to two controls, or that you implemented part 4 above, (2) that the preprocessing procedure makes sense, and (3) that your reward discounting is appropriate - some environments restart each time a reward is returned. \n",
