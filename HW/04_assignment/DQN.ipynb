    "So there we have it. Simple 1-step Q-Learning can solve easy problems very fast. Note that environments that produce images will be much slower to train on than environments (like CartPole) which return an observation of the state of the system. But this model can still train on those image-based games - like Atari games. It will take hours-days however. It you try training on visual environments, we recommend you run the most expensive step - rmsprop - less often (e.g. every 10 iterations). This gives about a 3x speedup. "
